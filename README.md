# Introduction
GPU vs CPU. 
This study aims to harness the strength of GPU when dealing with heavy computations. The advantage of GPUs over CPUs lies in the fact that GPU have relatively more cores as compared to CPUs. As a result, task that can be run parallel tend to be processed faster on GPUs than CPUs.

# Ancestry inference
Systematic analysis of the patterns in which genetic variants are shared among individuals and populations provides detailed accounts of population history. 

NB: Although most common variants are shared across the world, rarer variants are typically restricted to closely related populations
The ancestry will be inferred using the SNPs of from the whole genome sequence.


# Data set
The data set used for this study was obtained from the 1000 Genome’s project.

# Machine Learning Algorithms
Some selected machine learning algorithms were implemented on the dataset and their respective performances were evaluated and compared against each other in terms of performance.
